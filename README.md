# Hi there, I'm Subh! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a beginner developer dipping my toes into the world of coding. I'm passionate about building small, fun things with **web technologies** (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and **Python**. Right now, I'm focusing on the basicsâ€”learning by doing, experimenting, and fixing bugs one at a time. No massive apps here yet, just a collection of "things I've tried making" to practice and have a laugh along the way.

## Things I've Tried Making
Here's a peek at some of my early experiments. They're simple, but they've taught me a ton!

- **Web-Based Calculator**  
  A basic calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divisionâ€”perfect for quick math without leaving the browser.  
 

- **Flask Calculator with Web Frontend**  
  Took the calculator idea further by adding a Python backend with Flask. The web frontend sends requests to the server for calculationsâ€”my first taste of full-stack vibes.

- **Random Joke Generator**  
  A silly little app that fetches dad jokes from the [icanhazdadjoke.com API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/) using Javascript. Hit a button, get a groanerâ€”great for breaking the ice (or the tension during debugging).

## What's Next?
I'm excited to keep tinkeringâ€”maybe dive deeper into APIs, responsive design, or even a bit of data viz with Python. If you're a fellow beginner or have tips, feel free to say hi in the issues!

Thanks for stopping by. Happy coding! ðŸš€
